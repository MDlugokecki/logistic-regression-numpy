# logistic-regression-numpy
In this notebook I have implemented a solution for solving classiffication problem using logistic regression algorithm.
The class that I have written gets two parameters that can be passed while creating object for logistic regression. First is for regularization (default value is 0)
and the second is for automatic generation of polynomial features (default value is 1). The object also have method for estimating probability that tested example belongs
to class labeled as '1'.
All have been done using NumPy.
